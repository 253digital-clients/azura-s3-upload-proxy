# azura-s3-upload-proxy
A proxy server set up through Lightsail to accept streamed file chunks and then upload them to the S3 bucket for the Azura. This setup is designed to increase the transparency,logging and reliability of the lightweight file upload feature as opposed to using presigned urls from S3 and uploading from the browser.
